Travel time is an important performance measure in road operation and can help road users make informed trip decisions in the face of sudden variability in traffic and thus optimize the road network utilization. Traffic operators can take advantage of the real-time data when making timely decisions and the information can be used to assess the bottlenecks of the road network in the hopes of providing high quality information for infrastructure planning. Since 2008, a Bluetooth based travel time estimation system has received attention and research due to its non-invasiveness, cost-effectiveness and ease of installation. It derives the travel time information from the Bluetooth-enabled devices passengers carry with them in vehicles. The system is based on the concept of re-identifying vehicles at distinct sites and calculating the time it took the vehicle to travel the distance between them, but it lacks the privacy issues that haunt similar technologies such as automatic license plate recognition systems. Since the number of Bluetooth enabled devices on vehicles is expected to grow, the concept is seen as a promising alternative to more traditional travel time measurements technologies.
